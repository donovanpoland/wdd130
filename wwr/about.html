                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 1998, &copy;Splash White Water Rafting started as a small passion project by three adventure-loving friends who dreamed of sharing the thrill of river rafting with the world. 
                        Nestled in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, our company began with just a single raft, a handful of dedicated guides, and an ambition to provide unforgettable experiences on the water.
                        In the early days, we operated out of a tiny wooden cabin near the Snake River, offering weekend rafting trips to locals and thrill-seekers passing through. 
                        Word quickly spread about our expert guides, top-tier safety standards, and, most importantly, the heart-pounding excitement of navigating wild rapids. 
                        Within a few years, we expanded our fleet, added multi-day adventure packages, and built a state-of-the-art facility to welcome rafters of all skill levels. 
                        Today, &copy;Splash White Water Rafting is a premier rafting company, offering guided tours on some of the most exhilarating rivers in the country.
                        We've hosted thousands of adventurers, from first-time paddlers to experienced thrill-seekers, all looking to conquer the rapids and create lasting memories.
                        Through passion, dedication, and a love for the outdoors, we've built more than just a businessâ€”we've created a community of adventure lovers.
                        And we can't wait to welcome you to the ride of a lifetime!
